# Domain-Specific LLM for Financial Analysis

This project focuses on creating a domain-specific Language Model (LLM) for financial analysis. The system is designed to generate financial statements, summarize financial reports, and answer queries related to financial topics using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model.

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a financial statement generation and summarization system using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model.

## Features
- Data ingestion from transactional data and financial reports.
- Preprocessing and structuring of transactional data.
- Fine-tuning of the GPT-2 model on financial data.
- Generating financial statements from structured data.
- Summarizing financial reports.
- Answering financial queries using the fine-tuned model.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy transformers scikit-learn torch
```

## Usage
To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Ensure `transaction_data.csv` contains raw transactional data.
   - Ensure `financial_reports.csv` contains financial reports for analysis.

2. Fine-tuning the Model:
   - Run the Jupyter notebook `final.ipynb` to preprocess data, fine-tune the GPT-2 model, and perform inference tasks.

3. Inference and Task-Specific Functions:
   - Use the provided functions to generate financial statements, summarize reports, and answer queries.

## Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
The system ingests data from two primary sources:
- **Transaction Data**: Raw transactional data containing information about individual transactions.
- **Financial Reports**: Textual financial reports containing detailed financial information and insights.

## Model Fine-tuning
The pre-trained GPT-2 language model is fine-tuned on a combination of structured transaction data and textual financial reports. The fine-tuning process adapts the model to the financial domain, enabling it to perform specific financial tasks.

## Inference and Task-Specific Functions
- **Financial Statement Generation**: The `generate_financial_statement` function takes structured transaction data as input and uses the fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate a financial statement.
- **Financial Report Summarization**: The `summarize_financial_report` function takes a financial report text as input and generates a concise summary.
- **Query Answering**: The `answer_query` function allows users to ask questions about financial topics, and the model provides answers based on its knowledge.

## Model Deployment
The fine-tuned GPT-2 model and tokenizer are saved to disk for future use. Example usage scenarios are provided to demonstrate how the model can be utilized for financial statement generation, report summarization, and query answering.
